# NewLanguageTaster

I mainly do research on deep learning, so I usually use python to do almost anything.
However, after few months in my first company, understanding only python and writing every code in python is not an effective thing to do. Whereas python is good for data engineering or deep learning, other languages excel in other usages.
This is a repo to test out many languages, and to get used to them. I'm not good at these languages, but are keeping them as history. From trials and erros, I will refine the code on and on.
